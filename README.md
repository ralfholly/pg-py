# PG PY
A Playground for Python projects.


## Description
This playground for Python lets you try out Python features and programming ideas by setting up a safe try-out area super-fast. It is based on the idea described in [this blog post](https://www.approxion.com/?p=97).


## Usage
Enter the directory of the cloned repository and start a new topic:
```
cd ~/pg-cpp
. pg-setup dict_member_check
```
This will create a directory named `dict_member_check` that is equipped with a Makefile and a Python source code file named `dict_member_check.py`. If you have defined the `EDITOR` environment variable, `dict_member_check.py` will be opened in your favorite editor. Make your experiments and execute `make` to execute/test them.
